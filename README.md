PixVibe Mini Clone

A mini clone of the PixVibe app developed with Flutter; allows users to select images from the gallery, capture them via camera, apply desired image processing operations, and then save to the gallery or share directly.

To provide you with a better understanding of how my PixVibe Mini Clone application operates, I've prepared a brief demo video. This clip highlights the app's fundamental functionalities, including selecting images from the gallery, capturing new photos with the camera, applying image processing operations, and sharing or saving your edited images.
I am sharing the video through my Google Drive account, and you can find the link provided below.
